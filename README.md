# semrl
Semantic dependency parser with reinforcement learning.

## Requirements
Tensorflow

## Usage
### Parsing
*We will publish off-the-shelve models soon.*
### Trainging
#### Requirements
- This requires the semantic dependency parsing datasets:
  - https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2016T10
- The model also needs pretrained word mebedding vectors such as GloVe.
  - http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip

(Too be updated...)

## Updated soon
- Usage for training.
- Usage for parsing text files of CONLL format.
- Off-the-shelf parsing models for DM, PAS and PSD formalisms.
